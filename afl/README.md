The subdirectories here contain various fuzz harnesses for vodozemac.

# Setup

You will need a nightly Rust compiler for this to work:

```bash
$ rustup toolchain install nightly
```

After that afl-rs needs to be installed, the complete setup guide can be found
[here](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/afl/setup.html), you can install afl
with cargo:

```bash
$ cargo install afl
```

# Fuzzing

$ cd afl/olm-message-decoding
```

Build the harness using the cargo afl command:
