//! A Rust implementation of Olm and Megolm
//!
//! vodozemac is a Rust reimplementation of
//! [libolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm), a cryptographic library
//! used for end-to-end encryption in [Matrix](https://matrix.org). At its core, it
//! is an implementation of the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets, along
//! with a high-level API to easily establish cryptographic communication
//! channels employing those ratchets with other parties. It also implements
//! some other miscellaneous cryptographic functionality which is useful for
//! building Matrix clients, such as [SAS][sas].
//!
//! [sas]:
//! <https://spec.matrix.org/v1.2/client-server-api/#short-authentication-string-sas-verification>
//!
//! # Olm
//!
//! Olm is an implementation of the [Double Ratchet
//! algorithm](https://whispersystems.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/), very
//! similar to that employed by the Signal Protocol. It allows the establishment
//! of a 1-to-1 private communication channel, with perfect forward secrecy and
//! self-healing properties.
//!
//! A detailed technical specification can be found at
//! <https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/blob/master/docs/olm.md>.
//!
//! For more information on using vodozemac for Olm, see the [`olm`] module.
//!
//! # Megolm
//!
//! Megolm is an AES-based single ratchet for group conversations with a large
//! number of participants, where using Olm would be cost prohibitive because it
//! would imply encrypting each message individually for each participant.
//! Megolm sidesteps this by encrypting messages with a symmetric ratchet,
//! shared once with each participant and then reused for a sequence of messages
//! before rotating.
//!
//! This is a trade-off in which we lose Olm's self-healing properties, because
//! someone in possession of a Megolm session at a particular state can derive
//! all future states. However, if the attacker is only able to obtain the
//! session in a ratcheted state, they cannot use it to decrypt messages
//! encrypted with an earlier state. This preserves forward secrecy.
//!
//! A detailed technical specification can be found at
//! <https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/blob/master/docs/megolm.md>.
//!
//! For more information on using vodozemac for Megolm, see the [`megolm`]
//! module.

//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! ## Low-level API
//!
//! Feature: `low-level-api` (default: off)
//!
//! Vodozemac exposes some lower-level structs and functions that are only
//! useful in very advanced use cases. These should *not* be needed by the vast
//! majority of users.
//!
//! Extreme care must be taken when using such APIs, as incorrect usage can lead
//! to broken sessions.
//!
//! # Pickling
//!
//! vodozemac supports serializing its entire internal state into a form
//! a "pickle". The state can subsequently be restored from such a pickle
//! ("unpickled") in order to continue operation. This is used to support some
//! Matrix features like device dehydration.
//!
//! ## Legacy pickles
//!
//! The legacy pickle format is a simple binary format used by libolm.
//! Implemented for interoperability with current clients which are using
//! libolm. Only *unpickling* is supported.
//!
//! ## Modern pickles
//!
//! The crate also implements a modern pickling mechanism using
//! [Serde](https://serde.rs/). The exact serialization format is not mandated
//! nor specified by this crate, but you can serialize to and deserialize from
//! any format supported by Serde.
//!
//! The following structs support pickling:
//!
//! - [`olm::Account`]
//! - [`olm::Session`]
//! - [`megolm::GroupSession`]
//! - [`megolm::InboundGroupSession`]
//!
//! For example, the following will print out the JSON representing the
//! serialized `Account` and will leave no new copies of the account's secrets
//! in memory:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use anyhow::Result;
//! use vodozemac::olm::{Account, AccountPickle};
//!
//! const PICKLE_KEY: [u8; 32] = [0u8; 32];
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()>{
//!     let mut account = Account::new();
//!
//!     account.generate_one_time_keys(10);
//!     account.generate_fallback_key();
//!
//!     let pickle = account.pickle().encrypt(&PICKLE_KEY);
//!
//!     let account2: Account = AccountPickle::from_encrypted(&pickle, &PICKLE_KEY)?.into();
//!
//!     assert_eq!(account.identity_keys(), account2.identity_keys());
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can unpickle a pickle-able struct directly from its serialized form:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use anyhow::Result;
//! # use vodozemac::olm::{Account, AccountPickle};
//! # use zeroize::Zeroize;
//! #
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! #   let some_account = Account::new();
//!     let mut json_str = serde_json::to_string(&some_account.pickle())?;
//!     // This will produce an account which is identical to `some_account`.
//!     let account: Account = serde_json::from_str::<AccountPickle>(&json_str)?.into();
//!
//!     json_str.zeroize();
//! #
//! #    Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! However, the pickle-able structs do not implement `serde::Serialize`
//! themselves. If you want to serialize to a format other than JSON, you should
//! instead call the `.pickle()` method to obtain a special serializable struct.
//! This struct *does* implement `Serialize` and can therefore be serialized
//! into any format supported by `serde`. To get back to the original struct
//! from such as serializeable struct, just call `.unpickle()`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use anyhow::Result;
//! use vodozemac::olm::Account;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!     let account = Account::new();
//!     let account: Account = account.pickle().into();  // this is identity
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
