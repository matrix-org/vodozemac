# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2024-05-03

### Security Fixes

- Re-enable zeroization in the Dalek crates ([#130](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/130)) (Low, [CVE-2024-34063](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-34063), [GHSA-c3hm-hxwf-g5c6](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/security/advisories/GHSA-c3hm-hxwf-g5c6))


### Features

- Track the number of Diffie-Hellman ratchet advances in the Olm Session.
  This number is useful only for debugging purposes and will be included in the
  Debug output of the Olm `Session` ([#134](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/134)).

### Testing

- Add mutation tests ([#136](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/136)) ([#138](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/138)) ([#140](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/140)) ([#139](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/139)) ([#144](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/144)) ([#143](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/143)),
  special thanks to [Johannes Marbach](https://github.com/Johennes) for that.
- Enable mutation tests on CI ([#147](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/147)).

- Add base64 decoding and encoding methods to the public interface ([#112](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/112))


## [0.4.0] - 2023-05-31

### Bug Fixes

- Use the next key id from the libolm pickle instead of guessing

### Features

- Add a prettier display/debug implementation for Ed25519Signature
- Introduce an upgrade method to the InboundGroupSession struct
- Expose the version of vodozemac
- Make Debug representation of the public key types prettier
- Add a method to calculate the Session ID from a pre-key message
- [**breaking**] Return the created and discarded one-time keys when generating new ones ([#100](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/pull/100))
- [**breaking**] Return the fallback key which was removed when generating a new one
- Expose the build-time git commit hash and description as static vars
- Expose the Curve25519SecretKey type

### Refactor

- Rename the key_id field to next_key_id for clarity
